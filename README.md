# InstagramScrapper

> This Java application is supposed to access an instagram's profile `(given credentials)`
>  and get its following list.
>
> The main purpose of this application is to use and improve techniques and knowledges that will be guided by Selenium use. In other words: the error treatment, project pattern, objects mapper, use of database and, of course, the creation of a RESTful API that is able to accomplish its goal (comment on instagram post). 

  - Selenium
  - Spring
  - Basic JavaScript
  - Facade Pattern
  - H2 Database, JPA-Hibernate

### Installation and Execution

Requires Java JRE.

Requires download of Chrome Driver at [Selenium Documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/driver_requirements/).

Change `selenium.browserPath` tag at `application.properties` file with the path to `chromedriver.exe` you just downloaded. 

Run application.

### Endpoints 

##### Sign in (GET):

`localhost:8080/instagramscrapper/access?username=YOUR_USERNAME`

> This endpoint uses the given username to access the login page and sign in.

------------------------------------------------------------

##### Get profile info (GET):

`localhost:8080/instagramscrapper/profile?username=YOUR_USERNAME`

> This endpoint uses the given username (now stored in the database) to get profile info (followers and following quantities and the full non verified following list).

------------------------------------------------------------

##### Comment (POST):

`localhost:8080/instagramscrapper/comment`

> This endpoint uses the given username and instagram post url to use the logged account to comment successively.

body:
```json
{
    "username":"YOUR_USERNAME",
    "postUrl":"INSTAGRAM_POST_URL"
}
```

### TO-DO

This application is ~~currently~~ done being written. Check the next steps:

| Status | Implement detais |
| ------ | ------ |
| done | Do login |
| done | Access profile page and get some info |
| done | Get the full list of following |
| done | Get only username from list of following |
| done | Check if scroll is at bottom so don't scroll anymore |
| done | Improve method getUnverifiedFollowingUsernameList() |
| done | Remove post owner username from list |
| done | Comment username by username on a post |
| done | Implement a database to store the data |
| done | Make this application an RESTful API |
| done | Remove bug where browser opens at start |
| done | Treat errors properly |
| done | Update Installation and Execution section |
| done | Think about how to make the given password secure (do not store it!) |
| done | Map errors |
| `to-do` | ~~Incorporate Lombok (maybe one day)~~ |
| `to-do` | ~~Check if following account is commercial (maybe one day)~~ |

### Considerations

> Data scrapping Instagram is difficult because you may never know how data is shown. For example: you can not predict when Instagram suggests people to follow on following list. When it does, the application crashes.
> 
> The main goal was to use selenium, which gave the scenario, to use and improve my knowledge. ThatÊ½s the reason because some logic (like storing data, asking for information you already have on payload) seens rubbish: this application is about using databases, RESTful api concepts, errors treatments and so on.
> 
> For now, the use of Lombok and checking if following account is commercial is postponed because I think I achieved my intent.
